A utility for monitoring disk space that looks like this:

     ______________________________________ 
    / I'll let you know if there are less  \
    | than 100 MB free in /, /tmp, /var,   |
    | /var/log, /var/cache, /usr or /home. |
    \ Just let me run in the background.   /

        \      \__/
               (oo)\_______
